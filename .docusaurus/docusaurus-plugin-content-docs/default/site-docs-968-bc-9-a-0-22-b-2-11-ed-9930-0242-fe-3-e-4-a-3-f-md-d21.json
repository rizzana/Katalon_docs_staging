  "description": "Scripting your first mobile automation test case can be quite   confusing without a specialized tool or instruction. In this   tutorial, we will show you how to speed up your automation project   using Katalon Studio's mobile recording utility and run your   recorded test cases on hundreds of Kobiton's mobile devices on the   cloud. For this tutorial, we assume that you have already installed   Katalon Studio, got familiar   with its basic functions and registered a Kobiton account.",
