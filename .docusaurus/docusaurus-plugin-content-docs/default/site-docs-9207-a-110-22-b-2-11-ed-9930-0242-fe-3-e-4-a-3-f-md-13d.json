  "description": "Git is a version control system that enables you to track changes, merge codes, and return to earlier code versions when needed. The branching feature from Git allows you to create multiple branches of one project. With Git integration, you can improve team speed and productivity. Your team can collaborate on the same project without affecting each other.",
