  "description": "Desired capabilities can be useful when a user, for example,   wants to run mobile tests with a preferred platform, browser, or   app orientation. Katalon Studio uses desired capabilities to   communicate with Appium server by sending a POST request. If users   configure the desired capabilities in project settings, the Appium   server will start a session with predefined capabilities.",
